# Userscripts

These are some browser scripts that add new features to webpages or make the browsing experience more practical. These scripts require a script-engine browser extension, such as Tampermonkey, Violentmonkey or Greasemonkey, but some of them can be run as any other JavaScript snippet, like a bookmarklet.

To have the best compatibility with the userscripts in this directory, use Firefox with Tampermonkey. Other browsers or script-engines have much less priority in my testings, but should work (except Greasemonkey, which has some bugs in the engine).
