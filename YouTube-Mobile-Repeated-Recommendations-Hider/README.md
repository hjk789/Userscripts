# YouTube Mobile Repeated Recommendations Hider

Hide from YouTube's mobile browser homepage any videos that are recommended more than twice.

## About

This userscript enables you to keep your YouTube mobile homepage fresh with only new recommendations, automatically hiding any video that is recommended more than two times. The script works by storing in your script-manager's local storage the URL of every video that appears in your homepage. After the second time the same video is recommended, you won't see it ever more, as long as the script is enabled or the respective recommendation is included in the script's storage. In case you want to make it hide after only one time, so that only brand new recommendations are shown, you can freely change the max number of repetitions in the script to 1.

It was tested and works in Kiwi Browser with Tampermonkey on Android. Other mobile browsers that support installing script-managers may also work, although not tested.
