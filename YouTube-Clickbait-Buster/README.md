# YouTube Clickbait-Buster

Check whether it's worth watching a video by peeking it's content, viewing the thumbnail in full-size and displaying the full title. Works on both YouTube's desktop and mobile layouts.

## About

Sometimes you see a video in your recommendations with an interesting title or eye-catching thumbnail and clicks on it, just to find out the content wasn't what you were expecting or it was a clickbait. This userscript enables you to take a closer look on the video content before actually clicking on it.

To do that, you just need to click on the recommended video's menu (the three dots button) and choose the option you want. It works on almost all pages, such as the homepage, the video page, the subscriptions page, the search page and the channel page.

When you peek the video content, the script shows you the video's storyboard, which is a series of snapshots from the video in different moments from the beginning to the end.

If you don't like scrolling too much, you can change in the script the number of columns to your preference, so you can view more frames at once. Just note that it's limited by your device's screen size.

You can also view the video cover (thumbnail) in the highest resolution available. It's also limited to your screen size, but you can open the image in a new tab to view it in full size.

Additionally, the script also makes all titles be displayed in full, without any trimming or ellipsis.

This userscript was tested and works in Kiwi Browser with Tampermonkey on Android, and in Firefox on PC. Other browsers that support installing script-managers may also work, although not tested.
