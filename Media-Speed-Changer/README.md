# Media Speed Changer

Enables you to change the speed of video and audio with hotkeys (even if the video is inside an iframe)

## About

This userscript enables you to change the speed of video and audio with the PrintScreen, ScrollLock and Pause keys. It does this both for media in the page (HTML5 video or audio) or embeded media inside an IFRAME element. It was tested in both GreaseMonkey and TamperMonkey, although in GreaseMonkey some embeds won't change the speed, because of a bug in GreaseMonkey 4's IFRAME handling. So it works best on TamperMonkey.

### Hotkeys

- PrintScreen: 0.25x slower
- Pause/Break: 0.25x faster
- ScrollLock: Sets to 2.5x speed
- Ctrl + ScrollLock: Sets to 4x speed
- Ctrl + Insert: Sets to 16x speed
- Shift + ScrollLock: Sets to normal speed (1x)

You can freely change the keys or the speeds as you like. These are the ones that works best for me.
